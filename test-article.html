                           <span class="dateline">Berlin <span class="credit">(dpa)</span>&nbsp;- </span>The Paris climate agreement is "irreversible and non-negotiable," Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German Bundestag on Thursday, eight days ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg.</p>
                        <p>The European Union's remaining 27 members have expressed their "unequivocal" commitment to the accord despite the United States' decision to leave, Merkel told the Bundestag.</p>
                        <p>US&nbsp;President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that his country would cease participation in the 2015 agreement to halt climate change.</p>
                        <p>In an implicit reference to Trump, Merkel said that those "who believe the problems of this world can be solved though isolationism and protectionism are sorely mistaken - only together will we manage to find the right answers to the central questions of our time."</p>
                        <p>Addressing the Bundestag after the chancellor, Thomas Oppermann - parliamentary group leader for the centre-left Social Democrats - said that Merkel should use the summit to create a "19-to-1 alliance" excluding the US after its decision to abandon the agreement.</p>
                        <p>After her speech in parliament, Merkel met British Prime Minister Theresa May for a 30-minute meeting in preparation for the summit. </p>
                        <p>Later on Thursday, she was due to meet Spain's Mariano Rajoy, France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Norway's Erna Solberg, as well as EU&nbsp;leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, also in preparation for the summit.</p>
                        <p>Merkel is hosting the G20 summit on July 7-8, which will bring together leaders including Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
                        <p>Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to descend on the northern German city next week, and authorities are preparing for some demonstrations to turn violent. </p>
                        <p>Merkel said that protests were "more than legitimate in a democracy," but said she hopes they will remain peaceful.</p>
